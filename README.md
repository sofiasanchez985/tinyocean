# tinyocean
party with sharks in a miniature sea

This code works best on repl.it if the audio bits are commented out, lots of lag on the p5.js editor unfortunately :(

design inspiration:

I was hoping to create something like a koi pond/zen garden with relaxing, cool colors and images in the form of a tiny ocean.
The user can mouse over the waves to get them to change direction and color, and can click on the sharks to make them disperse, 
based on the proximity to the mouse and their original speed. I was inspired by an interactive koi pond I saw in a museum a few years ago, 
shown in the following YouTube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-zg-0gwkJM. 
In order to make it exciting, I added party mode!

hope you enjoy(:
